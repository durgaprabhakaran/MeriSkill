  Day 3: Campaign comparison using visualizations to identify the most profitable marketing channels.
  Day 4: Conversion Rate and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) analysis with clear charts and actionable insights.
  Day 5: Predictive analysis based on budget allocation with both equal and weighted models; visual comparisons (including clustered bar charts) to present optimized recommendations.
